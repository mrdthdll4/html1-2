This is a blog about an article by <a href="https://www.datapine.com/"> <i> <u> datapine </u> </i> </a> about what business dashboards are and why they are helpful to anyone who works in or around a business.
</p>

<p>
<i> <u> Datapine </u> </i> starts off by mentioning that anyone who works in a business is going to have some data that they must work with, and it is easiest if the data is all in one place. <i> <u> Datapine's </u> </i> dashboard can be used for anything business related that you can think of. They can be chosen by function, industry, or platform, and then you customize it afterwards to get it to your exact liking. And something that everybody loves; it's free! "No credit card required." <br>
The process of setting up your dashboard is very simple. And then you can share your dashboard with your colleagues or customers since the dashboards are internet-based. Which means no applications! You can use your dashboard on anything that runs the internet. And that means it is also available any time you need it. if you have a nightly business, or if you are on the other side of the world, you can still get to your information. Now of course, you will need to be able to have a device that can handle it, and that you interact with it though. But at least you don't need to go out and buy a fancy computer to run this.
</p>

<p>
<u> <i> Datapine </u> </i> also goes on to mention how not only do you have a lot of information scattered all over the place in your own personal work space, but your information is also scattered all over the place in the world. There are many different people/companies involved with other companies. You have your supply chain, supplies, finances, accountants, production line management, customer relations, and many more. You have a lot to monitor in different places, and of course with a business dashboard, you can get everything in one spot. <br>
It can also make complex information easier to understand. You can create visuals that can aid in identifying trends, ratios, fluctuations, and gleaning other useful information you may not have noticed if you were staring at a data set. This can also be used to determine your business' long-term health. If you have everything in one spot, it will be easier to tell if you are struggling, or if you are in a position to expand.
</p>

<p> The business dashboards also allow you to take large data sets and consolidate them for you. And this also cuts down on the manpower and time it usually takes to go through large data sets. <br>
That brings us to what the actual types of business dashboards are available. There are many types, but there are two main ones; analytical, and operational. "Analytical business dashboards are designed to afford you insight based on data collected over time." In short, they are for monitoring your business. "Operational dashboards are designed to help reveal whether business operations are on track or not." But more on quick side.

And then <u> <i> datapine </u> </i> goes on to give 5 useful tips to get the most out of your dashboard:
<!-- Ordered List Tag -->
<ol>
<li> "Make Your Metrics Matter:" Make sure you only add the stuff you need, don't waste space on the irrelevant stuff. </li>
<li> "Stick to Visuals:" Visuals make everything easier to understand. </li>
<li> "Make it Interesting:" Again, stick to visuals because everyone loves those, and that way your audience won't lose interest. </li>
<li> "Only Use Relevant Data:" Don't make any errors. Seems simple enough, right? </li>
<li> "Simple and Accessible:" Consider your audience and make sure everyone will be able to understand what it is present in the data. </li>
</ol>

<p>
<u> <i> datapine </i> </u> goes on to give 5 design tips, and 10 features that are essential. These are some features that really show you how helpful the dashboards would be in a business setting. Depending on the capabilities, and the personalization available. This is a great tool for businesses. And lastly they have 4 stories from real business users that share their account of how they used a business dashboard in their business.
</p>

5 Design tips to get the most out of your dashboard:
<!-- Ordered List Tag -->
<ol>
<li> "Use the right type of chart:" pick a chart that will be convey the point you want to get across to the audience. </li>
<li> "Have a color-consistency:" Only choose up to three colors so your audience isn't too overwhelmed. </li>
<li> "Stay away from clutter:" Don't try to put too much information in one page. You can use tabs to keep everything organized and still get all your information in. </li>
<li> "Put yourself in your audience's shoes:" Consider your specific needs for the dashboard and stick to that. </li>
<li> "Take advantage of datapine's dashboard templates:" The site has many templates that you can start from instead of having to design one from scratch if you can find one that will work for you that's already done. </li>
</ol>

10 features that are essential to get the most out of your dashboard:
<!-- Ordered List Tag -->
<ol>
<li> "Global styling options:" You can change things like fonts, colors, texts, and charts. </li>
<li> "Predefined dashboard themes:" You can save one dashboard layout and then switch between them, so you can have multiple different layouts for different needs. </li>
<li> "Existing dashboard library:" Once again there are 80+ pre-made dashboard templates that you can follow, or you can make your own. </li>
<li> "Dashboard tabs:" As mentioned above, use tabs to keep each section on point and avoid getting to much in one space. </li>
<li> "Widget linking:" You can bring elements from different dashboards that you have saved into another to make a summary dashboard, or if you just need to reference something without pulling up a whole new dashboard. </li>
<li> "Time interval widget:" You can have your time-period displayed so you can reference it a day, week, or month later. </li>
<li> "Multiple sharing option:" You can share a dashboard to your entire company if you need to. Maybe for a meeting or to get everyone caught up with the workings of the company (those that can see that of course). </li>
<li> "Embedded analytics:" You can embed internal company data on your intranet as well so you can have everything at easy acess. </li>
<li> "24/7 availability:" The sight is 24/7 so you can use it any time that you want to. And don't even worry if you are international user. If you have Wi-Fi, you have access to your dashboard. </li>
<li> "Printing bounds:" There may come a time when you may need a printed version, so there is a feature where you can print it and the formatting will remain intact. </li>
</ol>

My response to this article:
</h3>

<p>
I think that this article was very useful. I did not look at the exact date of when this resource became available to the public, but it seems new. I definitely think that is a good resource for anyone who works on the data side of a business. It is an easy way to get everything you need in one place, and you can cater your dashboard to your exact job/business. Not to mention how they have any type of visual you could possibly think of. As well as dashboards for so many different types of businesses.
</p>

<p>
I am a Business Analytics and Information Systems major. In this major I will most likely get a job where I will be working with business' data and telling them what they need to know about it. So this would be the perfect thing for me to have when I transition into the work force. <br>
And on top of that, since it fits so perfectly with what my job description would be, it is probably already helping so many people make their jobs easier. And when I do get my chances to use it, I am sure it will make my job so much easier. Another thing about that as well is that it is a good way to organize things for people. I am personally very organzied, so I may not necessarily need it to get organized. But I could use it to stay organized. Plus the types of visuals that are available make it look nice, and if you are sharing the dashboard with other people, you want it to look professional.
