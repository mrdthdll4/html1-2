<h3>
Why Is It Fun? 
</h3>
		
<p> HTML coding can be alot of fun. The best part is that you can open your web page file using two different programs and see how your tags impact the view in the browser. You'll want to open Notepad or TextEdit in one window and then start entering your code/tags. Then save the file with the correct extension (.html) and open it with your browser. Keeping the Notepad/ TextEdit file open on the other half of your screen. 
</p>

<center>
<p> You'll then have two windows open - your Notepad/TextEdit and your browser. You can make changes, save them and then refresh your browser to see the results. </p>
